      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>We’re two lifelong friends who’ve always shared a deep love for nature and the outdoors. After spending so many years exploring trials, rivers, and wild places, we decided it was time to turn that passion into something real. We then came upon this beautiful peace of land near the Buffalo National River, we knew it was the perfect spot to start somethign special.What started with a couple of cabins and a handful of canoes has grown into a dream come true. Our goal is to give people of all walks of life a place to explore, breathe, paddle,and expierence the same joy that inspired us from the beginning.  </p>
